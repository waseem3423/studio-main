## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke trust and efficiency.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0), nearly white, for a clean, professional feel.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF), for highlighting key actions and important information, creating a balance between calm professionalism and eye-catching vibrancy.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. The former will create a futuristic aesthetic while the later maintains great readability.
- Use simple, minimalist icons to represent different categories of data and actions.
- Mobile-friendly and responsive layout to ensure accessibility across different devices.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting.
